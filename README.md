# SbPocApp
This is a small chat poc on sendbird.

Before start replace YOUR_APP_ID text with your sendbird application ID in src/app/core/cofigurations/chat-config.ts

```groovy
export const chatConfig = {
    APP_ID: 'YOUR_APP_ID'
};
```

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.3.19.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


Open http://localhost:4200/ in two browsers and login with UserID HEAD-USER and USER-1, then it will start the chat between two users.
## Code scaffolding
